Sublime Text 3 User Settings
============

Sublime Text 3 Packages/User folder

## Dependancies

- Sublime Text 3 
- GitHub for Windows
- Node (npm)
- Ruby

## Instructions for Windows

- Install Node.js - http://nodejs.org/
- Install Ruby (1.9.3 for Grunt compatibility) - http://rubyinstaller.org/
- Install Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Sugest system restart to ensure packages are registered and PATH variable set.
- Install Sublime Text 3 - http://www.sublimetext.com/3
- - Add Package Control to Sublime Text - https://sublime.wbond.net/installation
- Shutdown Sublime Text
- Install GitHub for Windows - https://windows.github.com/
- Clone this repo to:
 
` C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages `

This will overwrite the existing User folder.
- Start Sublime Text - Package control should begin to downloading and installing the 'missing' packages. BE PATIENT - on an old laptop this took 15 mins plus during which time Sublime and laptop were unresponsive.
